# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# How incremental indexing works
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every chunk stored in ChromaDB includes an "mtime" metadata field —
# the file's last-modified timestamp at the time it was indexed.
#
# On each index_codebase() call:
#   1. Read current mtimes from disk  (os.path.getmtime per file)
#   2. Read stored mtimes from ChromaDB (_get_indexed_mtimes)
#   3. Skip files whose mtime hasn't changed  → no embedding cost
#   4. Re-embed files whose mtime changed     → delete old chunks first
#   5. Delete chunks for files no longer on disk
#
# doc_id format: "{filepath}::{chunk_name}::{start_line}"
# This makes each chunk uniquely addressable for upsert/delete.
